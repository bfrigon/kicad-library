This repository contains my libraries for Kicad, an open source EDA (http://www.kicad.org/). 

I didn't like the way the schematic symbols are drawn in the default libraries. Some of the symbols are too big or have pins that are too long. Also, as far as i know, all the passive components have IEC symbols. That's not a bad thing at all, i just prefer ANSI.


These are the rules i use for my libraries
- 100 mil pin length
- Footprint field hidden by default
- Smaller text size for value field (40 mil)
- Additional field (hidden by default) for part # on passive components
- Filled background for all symbols


Note: I am still in the process of converting my Eagle libraries to Kicad.
